  <h1>🟠 BTC Daily Blog – June 20, 2025</h1>
  <p>Bitcoin is trading at <strong>$104,247</strong> after rejecting near $105.7K resistance. Price is compressing under key levels, with $104K acting as local support.</p>

  <h2>🔑 Current Cycle Highlights:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>BTC Spot ETFs:</strong> Over a year of institutional inflows continue to reframe BTC as pristine macro collateral.</li>
    <li><strong>Macro Fuel:</strong> A Fed rate cut next FOMC could act as rocket fuel — risk-on appetite is simmering.</li>
    <li><strong>Altcoin Rotation:</strong> BTC dominance remains elevated. Until it cools, altcoins likely remain in rotation limbo.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🏦 The New "Retail": Public Treasuries Follow MSTR</h2>
  <p>MicroStrategy now holds over <strong>500,000 BTC</strong>, and their bold corporate treasury playbook is inspiring a new wave of public companies and sovereign entities to stack Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. From Japan to South Korea and even small U.S. public firms, we're witnessing the rise of "BTC Treasuries 2.0" — where corporations are now the new retail.</p>

  <p>Expect this trend to accelerate as fiat erosion becomes impossible to ignore. In 2020, buying BTC was contrarian. In 2025, it’s just good treasury management.</p>

  <p>💡 <em>Position smart. We’re still early. Don’t fumble the golden window.</em></p>
