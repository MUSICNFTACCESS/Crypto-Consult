  <h1>ðŸŸ  BTC Daily Blog â€“ June 20, 2025</h1>
  <p>Bitcoin is holding strong above the $110K range, maintaining its position as the apex asset of this cycle. ETF inflows continue to support upward momentum, while institutions and sovereign entities quietly accumulate.</p>

  <p>Key narratives today include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>BTC dominance remains elevated, confirming the capital rotation away from altcoins.</li>
    <li>Major wallets continue to accumulate, with whale activity ticking higher on-chain.</li>
    <li>Speculation grows around a potential Fed rate cut, which could ignite another BTC leg up.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Cycle tops are never clean â€” but this leg is far from done. Eyes on volume, ETF flow, and dominance. Crimzn out.</p>
